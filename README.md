## Important Instructions (for .exe users)
- When launching the .exe file, Windows may show a security warning. Click “More info” → “Run anyway” to proceed.
- After the terminal window appears, it may stay blank for several seconds. This is normal while the model initializes.
- The user interface will appear automatically once the setup is complete.
